## AGENT Guide for Project Iterations

### Overview
This document serves as a guide for both human collaborators and AI agents involved in the iterative process of the project. It outlines the checklist for the ten iterations, detailing the necessary sections to ensure a structured approach to documenting progress and findings.

### Iteration Checklist
For each iteration, the following sections must be addressed:

1. **De donde venimos**  
   - Summarize the previous iteration's findings and conclusions.
   - Highlight any challenges faced and how they were addressed.

2. **Donde queremos ir**  
   - Define the goals for the current iteration.
   - Specify what new insights or results are expected.

3. **Opciones para ir**  
   - List potential approaches or methodologies to achieve the goals.
   - Discuss any alternative strategies that could be considered.

4. **Vamos**  
   - Outline the steps to be taken in this iteration.
   - Assign tasks and responsibilities if applicable.

5. **A dónde hemos llegado**  
   - Document the outcomes of the current iteration.
   - Reflect on whether the goals were met and what was learned.

### Session Initialization Instructions
When initializing a session, the agent should follow these instructions:

1. Reference the iteration checklist outlined above.
2. Prepare for the document phases by ensuring all necessary materials and templates are accessible.
3. Mark the checklist upon completion of each iteration to track progress effectively.

### Iteration Process
- Each iteration will be documented in the corresponding markdown files located in the `docs` directory (iteration_01.md to iteration_10.md).
- Use the `templates/iteration_template.md` as a guide for structuring each iteration document.
- Ensure that all findings are clearly articulated and that any visual aids from the `assets` directory are appropriately integrated.

### Conclusion
This AGENT guide is designed to facilitate a smooth and organized iterative process. By adhering to the checklist and session initialization instructions, both human and AI participants can contribute effectively to the project's goals.

# SESSION_PROMPT

## Initialization Prompt for Iteration Sessions

Welcome to the session initialization for the iterative project on P vs NP. Please follow the instructions below to ensure a smooth process for each iteration.

### Instructions:

1. **Reference the Checklist**: Before starting each iteration, review the checklist outlined in AGENT.md. This checklist will guide you through the necessary steps and sections to complete.

2. **Prepare for Document Phases**: Familiarize yourself with the sections required for each iteration:
   - **De donde venimos**: Document the background and previous progress.
   - **Donde queremos ir**: Define the goals for this iteration.
   - **Opciones para ir**: Explore the possible approaches and methods to achieve the goals.
   - **Vamos**: Outline the action plan for this iteration.
   - **A dónde hemos llegado**: Summarize the outcomes and progress made during this iteration.

3. **Mark the Checklist**: Upon completion of each iteration, ensure to mark the corresponding item on the checklist in AGENT.md. This will help track progress and maintain organization throughout the project.

4. **Documentation**: Use the templates provided in the templates directory to maintain consistency across all iteration documents (docs/iteration_01.md to docs/iteration_10.md).

5. **Review and Reflect**: After each iteration, take a moment to review the completed document and reflect on the progress made. This will aid in planning for the next iteration.

### Ready to Begin?

Once you have reviewed the checklist and prepared for the document phases, you are ready to start the iteration. Good luck, and let’s make progress together!
