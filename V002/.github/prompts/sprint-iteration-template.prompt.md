# Sprint Iteration Documentation

Create a new sprint iteration file following this exact template structure for the Zeus project:

## Sprint Information
**Sprint ID**: [Sprint Number]_[Brief Description]  
**Phase**: [Current Phase from Checkpoint List]  
**Agent**: [Primary Agent Name/Specialization]  
**Start Date**: [Date]  
**Estimated Requests**: [Number]

## Objectives
### Primary Goals
- [ ] [Main objective 1 - be specific and measurable]
- [ ] [Main objective 2 - include success criteria] 
- [ ] [Main objective 3 - reference checkpoint IDs where applicable]

### Secondary Goals
- [ ] [Secondary objective 1 - nice-to-have features]
- [ ] [Secondary objective 2 - optimization or cleanup tasks]

## Checkpoints Addressed
### From zeus_main_checkpoint_list.md
- [ ] [Checkpoint ID]: [Checkpoint Description]
- [ ] [Checkpoint ID]: [Checkpoint Description]
- [ ] [Checkpoint ID]: [Checkpoint Description]

*Note: Only work on checkpoints assigned to your agent/phase*

## Technical Approach
### Architecture Decisions
- **Pattern Used**: [Describe specific diogenes pattern being followed]
- **Key Dependencies**: [List main dependencies - Express.js, HyperAxe, etc.]
- **Integration Points**: [External integrations needed - MCP servers, diogenes endpoints]

### Implementation Strategy
1. [Step 1 description - setup/preparation tasks]
2. [Step 2 description - core implementation]  
3. [Step 3 description - testing and validation]

## Work Log
*Document every request made during the sprint*

### Request 1
- **Action**: [What was requested/done]
- **Files**: [Files created, modified, or deleted]
- **Result**: [Outcome - success, partial completion, blocked]
- **Issues**: [Any problems encountered and how resolved]

### Request 2  
- **Action**: [What was requested/done]
- **Files**: [Files created, modified, or deleted]
- **Result**: [Outcome - success, partial completion, blocked]
- **Issues**: [Any problems encountered and how resolved]

*Continue for each request made during the sprint*

## Testing Performed
### Manual Testing
- [ ] [Test case 1 - functionality verification]
- [ ] [Test case 2 - integration testing]
- [ ] [Test case 3 - edge case validation]

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Diogenes compatibility verified
- [ ] Theme system functional
- [ ] Configuration persistence working
- [ ] Error handling tested

## Deliverables
### Files Created
- `[file path]` - [Description of file and its purpose]
- `[file path]` - [Description of file and its purpose]

### Files Modified
- `[file path]` - [Description of changes made]
- `[file path]` - [Description of changes made]

### Configuration Changes
- [Any configuration updates made]
- [Theme or i18n changes]

## Issues & Resolutions
### Blocking Issues
1. **Issue**: [Description of problem]
   **Resolution**: [How it was resolved or current status]
   **Impact**: [Effect on sprint timeline/scope]

2. **Issue**: [Description of problem]
   **Resolution**: [How it was resolved or current status]
   **Impact**: [Effect on sprint timeline/scope]

### Technical Challenges
- **Challenge**: [Technical difficulty encountered]
  **Solution**: [How it was addressed]
  **Learning**: [What was learned for future reference]

## Next Steps
### Immediate Tasks (Next Sprint)
1. [Task 1 - specific next action needed]
2. [Task 2 - dependencies for next agent]
3. [Task 3 - validation or testing needed]

### Dependencies for Next Agent
- **Required**: [Critical dependencies that must be completed first]
- **Helpful**: [Nice-to-have context or preparation]
- **Blockers**: [Any outstanding issues that could block progress]

### Handoff Information
- **Current State**: [Summary of where the project stands]
- **Key Files**: [Important files the next agent should know about]
- **Configuration**: [Any config changes or setup needed]

## Quality Gate Review
### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] English-only comments (no Spanish)
- [ ] Diogenes patterns followed correctly
- [ ] Configuration externalized (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed

### Documentation Quality
- [ ] All work documented in log
- [ ] Technical decisions explained
- [ ] Checkpoint status accurate
- [ ] Handoff information complete

### Integration Quality

- [ ] Theme system working
- [ ] Navigation consistent
- [ ] API patterns followed

## Sprint Retrospective
### What Went Well
- [Positive outcomes and successful approaches]
- [Effective tools or methods used]
- [Good collaboration or communication]

### What Could Be Improved
- [Areas for enhancement in next sprints]
- [Process improvements identified]
- [Technical challenges to address]

### Lessons Learned
- [Key insights for future sprints]
- [Technical knowledge gained]
- [Process refinements needed]

### Recommendations for Future Sprints

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy this template** to `PLANIFICACION/VIBECODING/ITERATIONS/`
2. **Name the file** following pattern: `sprint_[XX]_[description].md`
3. **Fill out all sections** as work progresses
4. **Update regularly** - don't wait until sprint end
5. **Be specific** - include file paths, error messages, exact steps taken
6. **Focus on handoffs** - next agent needs clear context

## Quality Requirements

- **Completeness**: All sections must be filled out
- **Accuracy**: Work log must match actual changes made
- **Clarity**: Technical decisions must be well-documented
- **Specificity**: Include exact file paths, commands used, errors encountered
- **Continuity**: Provide clear context for the next agent to continue work
